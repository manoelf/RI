Hi, we are trying to keep awake and understand the video about Naive Bayes

Target concept Interesting?: Document -> {+,-}

1 - Represents each document by a vector of words
2 - Learning: Use training examples to stimate

Simple math:
	p(+) : Documents hated as positives
	p(-) : Documents hated as negative
	Wk   : Specific word 
	nk   : Number of times that the word appear
	n    : Total of words (includes repetions) in all docs
    |vocabulary| : Number of words in the vocabulary

p(+) = total of documentes hated as positive / total of documents

p(Wk|+) = (nk + 1)/(n + |vocabulary|)
